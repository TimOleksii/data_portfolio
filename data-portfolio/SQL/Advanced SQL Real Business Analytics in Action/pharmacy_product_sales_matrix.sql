Full Pharmacy-Product Sales Table
====================================================================================

Business context:
To analyze overall product performance across all pharmacy branches, we build a 
comprehensive matrix of sales volumes per product per pharmacy.

This analysis helps to:
- Identify gaps in product availability or demand
- Compare branch-level sales performance for the same product
- Provide structured input for further analysis (e.g., clustering, imputation)

Technical details:
- Rows represent all combinations of pharmacies and products (even if no sales)
- If a product wasn't sold at a specific pharmacy, 'cnt' will be NULL
- Sales count is rounded to two decimal places

Final output:
| apt | drug       | cnt   |
