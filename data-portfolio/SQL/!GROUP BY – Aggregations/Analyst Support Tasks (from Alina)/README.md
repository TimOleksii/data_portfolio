# Analyst Support Tasks (from Alina)

This folder contains SQL tasks based on a simulated real-world scenario where you assist a fellow analyst named Alina.  
She has a strong background in BI dashboards but is new to SQL, and asks for help on several data-related hypotheses and reporting requests.

These tasks imitate real collaboration between analysts during a data internship or junior analyst position.
