# Monetization Analytics (Robert’s Subscription Project)

This folder contains SQL tasks and business analysis simulations related to the platform’s planned shift from a virtual currency model (CodeCoins) to a subscription-based monetization strategy.

The tasks are based on a business request from the marketing department lead, Robert, who outlined key metrics to evaluate user behavior and support pricing and structure decisions for the new subscription model.

## Business Context

Currently, the platform rewards users with internal coins (CodeCoins) for activity, which can also be purchased and spent on premium content. However, user purchases are low and inconsistent.

The company is now testing a subscription-based model and needs analytical support to decide on:

- Number and duration of subscription tiers
- Subscription pricing strategy
- Which features to include or restrict in free vs paid plans

---

## Key Metrics to Analyze

Robert asked to calculate and explore the following:

- **n-day retention**
- **Rolling retention**
- **Average and median number of solved tasks/tests**
- **Average CodeCoin spent/earned per user and net difference**
- **User balance distribution (percentiles)**
- **% of sessions with no activity**
- **MAU (Monthly Active Users)**

## Notes

- All tasks in this folder are part of a **realistic simulation of an entry-level data analyst role**.
- The full database schema is available in the root of the SQL directory:
