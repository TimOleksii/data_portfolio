# Simple Aggregation Tasks

This folder contains warm-up tasks related to the topic of GROUP BY and aggregations.

Most of the exercises here are designed for initial exploration and familiarization with aggregation concepts and the database structure.

All tasks in this folder are based on a single, dedicated table â€” `transactions`.
