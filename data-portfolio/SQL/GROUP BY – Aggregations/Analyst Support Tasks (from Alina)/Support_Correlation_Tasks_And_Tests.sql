-- Task:
-- Calculate the correlation between the number of task activities
-- (coderun + codesubmit) and test activities (teststart)
-- per day.

-- Output:
-- - cnt_corr â†’ correlation coefficient between task count and test count
--   (rounded to 2 decimal places)

-- Notes:
-- - If there were only tasks or only tests on a given day,
--   the missing value should be treated as 0.
-- - coderun and codesubmit represent tasks (joined via UNION ALL).
-- - Dates must be aligned using FULL OUTER JOIN.
