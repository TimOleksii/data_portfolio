====================================================================================
Top MCC Groups by Transaction Sum (Monthly, 2019)
====================================================================================

Business context:
We want to understand which MCC groups dominate monthly user spending. This helps 
identify seasonal leaders and outliers by comparing them to the next best group.

Objective:
- For each month of 2019, determine the MCC group with the highest total transaction value
- Also calculate:
    - `abs_diff`: absolute difference in total spend between 1st and 2nd place
    - `rel_diff`: relative difference as a ratio between 1st and 2nd place
- If a month has no transactions: return nulls for all fields except `month`
- If a month has only 1 group: `abs_diff` and `rel_diff` = null
- If groups are tied by amount: sort alphabetically by group_name

Final columns:
| group_name | month | tr_sum | abs_diff | rel_diff |

All monetary values rounded to 2 decimal places. Final result ordered by month (1â€“12).
