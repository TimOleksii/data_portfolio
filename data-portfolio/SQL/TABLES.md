# SQL Table Reference

Some practice tasks rely on a simplified `transactions` table used to illustrate aggregation and window function concepts. The key columns are:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Record identifier |
| `id_transaction` | Transaction ID |
| `card_id` | Card number |
| `maincard_id` | Master card number |
| `date` | Date and time of the transaction |
| `sum` | Transaction amount |
| `type` | Transaction type |
| `employee` | Employee name |
| `doc_id` | Receipt identifier |
| `cash_id` | Cash register number |
| `shop_id` | Shop/store ID |
| `doc_type` | Document type |
| `disc_id` | Discount ID |
| `disc_source` | Source of the discount |
