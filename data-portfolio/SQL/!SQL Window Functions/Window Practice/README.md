# ü™ü Window Functions ‚Äì Practice Tasks

This folder contains focused SQL practice tasks using **window functions** such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER`, and others.

All tasks are built on top of a single table: `transactions`, which simulates purchase operations in a retail environment.
